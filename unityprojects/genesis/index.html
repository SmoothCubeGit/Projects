        <h1>Devlog: Genesis - 2D/3D Level Creation Tool</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Genesis</em> is a creative design tool designed to offer a unique platform for users to build, test, and share their own projects in a way similar to other creative construction tools. The project focused primarily on the construction system and interface functionality, providing a framework for creation and exploration. Although sharing functionality wasn't fully implemented, the tool allowed for an intuitive and enjoyable creation experience.</p>

        <h2>Features and Systems Created</h2>

        <h3>Building System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UI Elements:</strong> Utilized a UI pack from Kenney, custom fonts from DaFont, and a custom logo to design an attractive user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Object Creation:</strong> Enabled both simple and complex object creation, allowing users to easily design their environments with various objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Platformer Movement:</strong> Developed a movement system inspired by traditional physics-based mechanics, allowing for smooth interactions with created spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom AI:</strong> Implemented an AI system to populate spaces with interactive elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gameplay Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera and Lighting:</strong> Integrated a camera system that adjusts based on activity and enhanced lighting effects using Unity's URP, which added bloom effects for a more atmospheric experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Spawnpoint and Reset System:</strong> Created systems for object placement and reset management to ensure proper flow during project interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving and Loading:</strong> Developed a framework to save and load objects between build and test modes, making it easier for users to switch between designing and testing creations.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Properties:</strong> Added properties like "Has Rigidbody" and "Has AI" to objects, giving them additional functionality in the design world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Audio and Visual Effects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sound Effects:</strong> Implemented walking sound effects to enhance user interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Used animations from Mixamo to provide movement within the project space.</li>
            <li><strong>Triplanar Textures:</strong> Used triplanar texturing for dynamic surface mapping to objects within the environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Development Highlights</h2>

        <h3>Most Satisfying Achievements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lighting Effects:</strong> The use of Unity's URP to create bloom effects for lighting was particularly rewarding and helped to elevate the overall visual quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Building System:</strong> The intuitive building system made it easy for users to design and create quickly, which was a key feature of the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Challenges and Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Atmospheric Sound Effects:</strong> The creation could have benefited from a more extensive set of sound effects to create a richer atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Object Selection:</strong> More objects and assets could be added to the creation system to provide greater variety and flexibility for users.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>This project provided invaluable experience in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building a flexible 2D/3D creation tool.</li>
            <li>Implementing custom AI and movement mechanics for a simulation-style experience.</li>
            <li>Creating a user-friendly UI system to facilitate creation and testing.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><em>Genesis</em> successfully achieved its goal of creating a creation tool with a working build and test system, although there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of adding more assets and sound effects. The project provided valuable learning opportunities in design and UI development, offering a solid foundation for future enhancements and sharing capabilities.</p>
