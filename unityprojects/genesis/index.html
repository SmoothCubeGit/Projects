        <h1>Devlog: Genesis - 2D/3D Level Creation Tool</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Genesis</em> is a game creation tool designed to offer a unique platform for users to build, play, and share their own levels in a Mario Maker-like environment. The project focused primarily on the building system and UI functionality, providing a framework for level creation and gameplay. Although sharing functionality wasn't fully implemented, the tool allowed for an intuitive and enjoyable game creation experience.</p>

        <h2>Features and Systems Created</h2>

        <h3>Building System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UI Elements:</strong> Utilized a UI pack from Kenney, custom fonts from DaFont, and a custom logo to design an attractive user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Object Creation:</strong> Enabled both simple and complex object creation, allowing users to easily design their levels with various objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Platformer Movement:</strong> Developed a player movement system inspired by platformer games, allowing for smooth interactions with created levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom AI:</strong> Implemented a Goomba-like AI to populate levels with enemies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gameplay Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera and Lighting:</strong> Integrated a camera system that adjusts based on gameplay and enhanced lighting effects using Unity's URP, which added bloom effects for a more atmospheric experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Spawnpoint and Death System:</strong> Created systems for player spawning and death management to ensure proper gameplay flow during level playthroughs.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving and Loading:</strong> Developed a framework to save and load objects between build and play modes, making it easier for users to switch between designing and testing levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Properties:</strong> Added properties like "Has Rigidbody" and "Has AI" to objects, giving them additional functionality in the game world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Audio and Visual Effects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sound Effects:</strong> Implemented walking sound effects to enhance the player's movement experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Used animations from Mixamo to provide character and object movements within the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Triplanar Textures:</strong> Used triplanar texturing for dynamic surface mapping to objects within the level.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Development Highlights</h2>

        <h3>Most Satisfying Achievements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lighting Effects:</strong> The use of Unity's URP to create bloom effects for lighting was particularly rewarding and helped to elevate the overall visual quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Building System:</strong> The intuitive building system made it easy for users to design and create levels quickly, which was a key feature of the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Challenges and Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Atmospheric Sound Effects:</strong> The game could have benefited from a more extensive set of sound effects to create a richer atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Object Selection:</strong> More objects and assets could be added to the game creation system to provide greater variety and flexibility for users.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>This project provided invaluable experience in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building a flexible 2D/3D level creation tool.</li>
            <li>Implementing custom AI and player movement mechanics for a platformer-style game.</li>
            <li>Creating a user-friendly UI system to facilitate level creation and testing.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><em>Genesis</em> successfully achieved its goal of creating a level creation tool with a working build and play system, although there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of adding more assets and sound effects. The project provided valuable learning opportunities in game development and UI design, offering a solid foundation for future enhancements and sharing capabilities.</p>
